The report must follow this exact structure and meet the detailed content requirements for each section:\n\n1.  **Executive Summary**\n    *   Provide a high-level overview of the key findings, including the overall cost structure, fraud risk level, and primary recommendations for each merchant.\n    *   Summarize the most significant opportunities for cost savings and risk reduction.\n\n2.  **Problem Definition & Objectives**\n    *   Clearly state the goal of the analysis: to optimize payment processing fees and minimize fraud-related costs for the merchants listed in `merchant_data.json`.\n    *   Define the key performance indicators (KPIs) to be analyzed, such as average transaction cost, fraud rate, authorization rate, and the impact of transaction characteristics (ACI, card scheme, etc.) on fees.\n\n3.  **Methodology**\n    *   **3.1 Data Sources & Integration:** Detail how the datasets (`payments.csv`, `fees.json`, `merchant_data.json`, `acquirer_countries.csv`, `merchant_category_codes.csv`) were integrated. Explain the linking keys (e.g., `merchant` name, `merchant_category_code`, `acquirer` name to country).\n    *   **3.2 Fee Calculation & Feature Engineering:** Describe the precise process for calculating the fee for each transaction in `payments.csv` by matching its attributes (e.g., `merchant`, `card_scheme`, `is_credit`, `aci`, `acquirer_country`, `issuing_country`) to the applicable rule in `fees.json`. Explicitly state the formula: `fee = fixed_amount + (rate * eur_amount / 10000)`.\n    *   **3.3 Analytical Framework:** Explain the analytical approach used, such as grouping transactions by merchant and key characteristics to compare actual fees against potential optimal scenarios (e.g., using a different ACI, ensuring intracountry routing).\n\n4.  **Analysis of Current State**\n    *   **4.1 Merchant Profile Analysis:** For each merchant, present a profile including their account type, MCC, primary acquirers, and typical capture delay.\n    *   **4.2 Transaction Cost Analysis:** Analyze the current fee structure for each merchant. Break down costs by contributing factors (e.g., card scheme, ACI, intracountry status). Use tables and/or charts to present average fees, total monthly costs (estimated), and the distribution of fees.\n    *   **4.3 Fraud & Risk Assessment:** Calculate and discuss the current fraud rate (based on `has_fraudulent_dispute`) and refusal rate (based on `is_refused_by_adyen`) for each merchant. Assess the associated cost implications based on the rules in the manual.\n\n5.  **Optimization Opportunities & Recommendations**\n    *   **5.1 Cost Reduction Strategies:** For each merchant, provide specific, actionable recommendations. These must be justified by referencing the manual\"s best practices and the fee rules in `fees.json`. Examples include:\n        *   Proposing a change in ACI to a cheaper, secure alternative.\n        *   Recommending a switch to a different acquirer to enable intracountry transactions and lower fees.\n        *   Suggesting optimizations to `capture_delay` if applicable.\n    *   **5.2 Fraud Mitigation Strategies:** Provide recommendations for reducing fraud-related fees, referencing sections of the manual (e.g., implementing AVS, CVV checks, 3D Secure).\n    *   Quantify the potential cost savings for each recommendation where possible.\n\n6.  **Discussion**\n    *   **6.1 Strengths of Current Setup:** Acknowledge any positive aspects of the current payment configurations.\n    *   **6.2 Limitations & Weaknesses:** Discuss any limitations in the data or analysis, such as missing fields (e.g., `email_address`), the synthetic nature of the data, or assumptions made during the fee calculation.\n    *   **6.3 Constraints:** Mention any potential operational constraints for implementing the recommendations (e.g., technical feasibility of changing ACI, contractual agreements with acquirers).\n\n7.  **Conclusion**\n    *   Reiterate the most critical findings and summarize the prioritized recommendations for each merchant.\n    *   Emphasize the potential impact on the bottom line through optimized payment processing.\n\n8.  **Appendix**\n    *   Include a glossary of key terms (e.g., ACI, MCC, Intracountry) as defined in the manual.\n    *   Provide a sample calculation for a representative transaction to illustrate the fee calculation process.\n\nEnsure the report is data-driven, with specific figures and percentages cited from the analysis.

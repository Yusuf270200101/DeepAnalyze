| | 2019 | | 2018
In thousands | $ | % | $ | %
Drinkable Kefir other than ProBugs | $ 71,822 | 77% | $ 78,523 | 76%

Frozen Kefir (a) | 1,617 | 2% | 1,434 | 1%
Net Sales | $ 93,662 | 100% | $ 103,350 | 100%
Context: Paragraph 1: Our product categories are: Paragraph 2: Drinkable Kefir, sold in a variety of organic and non-organic sizes, flavors, and
types, including low fat, non-fat, whole milk, protein, and BioKefir (a 3.5 oz. kefir with additional probiotic cultures). Paragraph 3: Europeanstyle soft cheeses, including farmer cheese in resealable cups. Paragraph 4: Cream and other, which consists primarily of cream, a byproduct of
making our kefir. Paragraph 5: ProBugs, a line of kefir products designed for children. Paragraph 6: Other Dairy, which includes Cupped Kefir and
Icelandic Skyr, a line of strained kefir and yogurt products in resealable cups. Paragraph 7: Frozen Kefir, available in soft serve and pint-size
containers. Paragraph 8: Lifeway has determined that it has one reportable segment based on how our chief operating decision maker manages the
business and in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision
maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing our performance, has been identified collectively as the Chief Financial Officer,
the Chief Operating Officer, the Chief Executive Officer, and Chairperson of the board of directors. Substantially all of our consolidated
revenues relate to the sale of cultured dairy products that we produce using the same processes and materials and are sold to consumers through a
common network of distributors and retailers in the United States. Paragraph 9: Net sales of products by category were as follows for the years
ended December 31: Paragraph 10: (a) Includes Lifeway Kefir Shop sales Paragraph 11: Significant Customers – Sales are predominately to companies
in the retail food industry located within the United States. Two major customers accounted for approximately 22% and 21% of net sales for the
years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Two major customers accounted for approximately 17% of accounts receivable as of December
31, 2019 and 2018. Our ten largest customers as a group accounted for approximately 57% and 59% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019
and 2018, respectively.
Question: What is the change in the net sales for cheese between 2018 and 2019?
Thought 1: I need to retrive the net sales for cheese for 2018 and 2019.
Action 1: Retrieve[net sales for cheese for 2018 and 2019]
Observation 1: | 2019 | 2018 |
| 11459 | 11486 |
Thought 2: I need to substract the net sales for cheese for 2019 from 2018, which results in the formular: [11459 - 11486]
Action 2: Calculate[11459 - 11486]
Observation 2: -27
Thought 3: The question asks for change in the net sales for cheese between 2018 and 2019. The answer is in the observation 2, which is -27. The
unit/scale of the number is thousand, therefore the answer is -27 thousands.
Action 3: Finish[-27 thousands]

| | Three Months Ended | | % Variation |
| December 31, 2019 | September 29, 2019 | December 31, 2018 | Sequential | Year-Over-Year
| | | (Unaudited, in millions) | |
Automotive and Discrete Group (ADG) | $924 | $894 | $967 | 3.3% | (4.5)%
Analog, MEMS and Sensors Group (AMS) | 1,085 | 968 | 988 | 12.1 | 9.9

Others | 3 | 3 | 4 | — | —
Total consolidated net revenues | $2,754 | $2,553 | $2,648 | 7.9% | 4.0%
Context: Paragraph 1: On a sequential basis, ADG revenues were up 3.3%, driven by an increase in volumes of approximately 8%, partially offset by
a decrease in average selling prices of approximately 5%, mostly attributable to product mix. Paragraph 2: AMS revenues increased 12.1% driven by
Analog and Imaging products. AMS increase was due to an increase of approximately 5% in average selling prices, entirely due to product mix, and
to higher volumes of approximately of 7%. Paragraph 3: MDG revenues increased by 7.9%, mainly driven by Microcontrollers, due to both higher
product mix, and higher volumes of approximately 2%. Paragraph 4: On a year-over-year basis, fourth quarter net revenues increased
by 4.0%. ADG revenues decreased 4.5% compared to the year-ago quarter on lower revenues in both Automotive and Power Discrete. The decrease was
entirely due to lower average selling prices of approximately 4%, while volumes remained substantially flat. The decrease in average selling
prices was a combination of less favorable product mix and lower selling prices. Paragraph 5: AMS fourth quarter revenues grew 9.9% year-overyear, mainly driven by Analog and Imaging. The increase was entirely due to higher average selling prices of approximately 18%, entirely
attributable to product mix,
partially offset by lower volumes of approximately 8%. MDG fourth quarter revenues increased by 7.6%, mainly driven by Microcontrollers. The
increase was due to higher average selling prices of approximately 9%,
entirely due to improved product mix.
Question: What led to increase in the revenue of ADG on sequential basis?
Thought 1: I need to look up what led to increase in the revenue of ADG on sequential basis in the context.
Action 1: Look up[what led to increase in the revenue of ADG on sequential basis]
Observation 1: On a sequential basis, ADG revenues were up 3.3%, driven by an increase in volumes of approximately 8%, partially offset by a
decrease in average selling prices of approximately 5%, mostly attributable to product mix.
Thought 2: The question asks what led to increase in the revenue of ADG on sequential basis, the answer is in the observation 1, which is: an
increase in volumes of approximately 8%, partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices of approximately 5%, mostly attributable to
product mix. There is no unit or scale needed as the answer is not a number.
Action 2: Finish[an increase in volumes of approximately 8%, partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices of approximately 5%, mostly
attributable to product mix.]
Table:
| March 31, |
| 2019 | 2018
Raw materials | $74.5 | $26.0
Work in process | 413.0 | 311.8
Finished goods | 224.2 | 138.4
Total inventories | $711.7 | $476.2
Context: Paragraph 1: Inventories Paragraph 2: The components of inventories consist of the following (in millions): Paragraph 3: Inventories are
valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method. Inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis
for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are
recoverable.
Question: What was the percentage change in total inventories between 2018 and 2019?
Thought 1: I need to retrieve the total inventories of 2018 and 2019 respectively.
Action 1: Retrieve[total inventories of 2018 and 2019]
Observation 1: | 2019 | 2018 |
| $711.7 | $476.2 |
Thought 2: I need to calculate the percentage using the formular: [((711.7-476.2)/476.2)*100]
Action 2: Calculate[((711.7-476.2)/476.2)*100]
Observation 2: 49.45.
Thought 3: The question asks for percentage change of total inventories between 2018 and 2019. The answer is in the observation 2, which is 49.45.
The unit/scale of the number is percentage, therefore the answer is 49.45%

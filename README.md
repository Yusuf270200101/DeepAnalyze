**DeepAnalyze** is the first agentic LLM for autonomous data science. It can autonomously complete a large number of data-centric tasks, supporting:
- **Entire data science pipeline**: data preparation, data analysis, buliding ML model, data visualization, and report generation.
- **Open-ended data research**: given various data sources, do research and generate analyst-grade research report.
- **Various data types**, including: structured data (Databases, CSV, Excel), semi-structured data (JSON, XML, YAML), and unstructured data (TXT, Markdown).


> [!TIP]
>
> You can directly deploy DeepAnalyze on your local system as your data analyst to complete any data science tasks without the need to design any workflow or Closed-source API.
